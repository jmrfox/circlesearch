This is a repo for a study of Jonathan Wild's circle interesection problem in Python. 
I am using the `uv` package manager. Python scripts are run with `uv run <script.py>`.
The main Python code lives in the `circlesearch` directory. Scripts live in the `scripts` directory. Tests live in the `tests` directory.
